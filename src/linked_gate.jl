LinkedGate is a subtype of Conception.AbstractConcept to mark that it's not supposed to become part of hte history: It is not a temporal element, since a transition throught a gate happens instantaneosly.

    - nodeA : node that can be activated, on one side of gate.
    - nodeB : node that can be activated, on one side of gate.
    - condition : node that can be activated; gate keeper.
